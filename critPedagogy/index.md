# Critical Pedagogy Resources

Below are some resources for critical and radical pedagogy. Right now I am formatting it for a reading group at Temple University, AY 2015-2016.

###Meeting 1 (Dec 9, 3:30pm)

1. [Chatterton, Paul. Using geography to teach freedom and defiance: Lessons in social change from 'autonomous geographies'.](/assets/uploads/chatterton - using geography to teach freedom and defiance _ lessons in social change from autonomous geographies.pdf)

2. [Freire, Paolo. Pedagogy of the oppressed. Preface, Ch 1](/assets/uploads/freire - pedagogy of the oppressed preface 1.pdf)

Supplemental reading: 

In one of the most unlikely pairings, this author considers how to incorporate Freire's radical democratization into arguably the most symptomatic indicator of the neoliberalizing university: the MOOC. I'm curious to see how it goes down.

[If Freire Made a MOOC: Open Education as Resistance](http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/journal/freire-made-mooc-open-education-resistance/)
