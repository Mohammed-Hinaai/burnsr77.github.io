Let's test this whole crowdsourcing business here (not that I get a whole hell of a lot of comments, but hey...).

At this point I'm open to future academic as well as non-academic jobs, but I'm having a hard time keeping track of all the organizations and institutions that may be of interest later. There are dozens of think-tanks, small liberal arts colleges with an interesting division, and humanitarian organizations, among others... How do *you* keep track of interesting organizations and institutions that you'd like to remember later? 

I could just bookmark them all, but there's a chance I could lose them by switching browsers or in a hard drive crash. I could email myself, but that would get unruly after a while. I suppose I could save a draft here in WordPress, but that has its limitations as well. What say you?
