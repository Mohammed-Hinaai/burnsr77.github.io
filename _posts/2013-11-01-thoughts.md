- Words I tell all my students to rid from their vocabulary: "I think" and "I feel," "biased" and "subjective," "bad" and "good," "I agree" and "I disagree," "true" and "false," and, believe it or not, "society" (because people have a tendency to use this term very un-critically, as a blanket for other, more nuanced ways social groups form and relate to each other). I think one of the biggest obstructions to learning is to rely on concepts that are unquestioned and seemingly apolitical, and by thinking beyond the list above - either by replacing them with more specific terms or by shifting one's approach to evaluating an idea - one begins to understand the depth and richness in social relations.

- In both popular and academic conversations, I've been noticing a proclivity to assume that the world as it is right now is the most ideal, most perfect of all possible worlds. In other words, because the world now has what it has, this must be the best possible historical development. This way of thinking implicates how people think about linkages between society and technology, science, and even political economy. I want to point to Ashbery's lines in "Self-portrait...": <blockquote>What is beautiful seems so only in relation to a specific<br>Life, experienced or not, channeled into some form<br>Steeped in the nostalgia of a collective past.</bockquote> 

- I have a collection of dreams that I'm jotting down and one day I'll compile them into a one really bizarre, unsettling film script.

- Magritte's apt distinction between representation and object eludes the majority of people, and I have to continuously remind myself of that. Representation is never reality, yet it always produces relations. <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b9/MagrittePipe.jpg" />

- Stop saying "particular kinds of assumptions/implications/impacts/relations." Be specific. What kinds? What are the assumptions?

- It's one of those a) days, b) weeks, c) months: a) 91 emails received today in my inbox I need to delete and probably over 100 I already deleted; b) haven't worked nearly enough on the paper I'm writing and I need to start focusing on the dissertation; c) what have I gotten accomplished this month UGH.
