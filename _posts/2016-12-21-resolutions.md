Over the last few years my love of making new years resolutions has been supplanted by a sheer survival instinct: running long distances was my means of self-preservation, not a hobby, and reading fiction essential to reading students' exams. Enjoyable pastimes became unaffordable due to moving expenses and new student loan payback bills. So, in 2015 I recorded listening to the least amount of music of any year since 2008 - the year I started seriously keeping track; 2016 is set to surpass it (meaning, even less music). I simply didn't care to keep track anymore, and most the music I listened to was old, dependable, feel-good, standby favorites.

At the same time, this year, with my moving into a tenure-track position, I'm beginning to feel a sense of stability and security that has freed some mental space for more pleasurable endeavors. I read more books this year than I ever have (journal articles not included, and in grad school most my book-reading consisted of exerpts). I've regained some momentum that I hope will launch an awesome 2017. In short, I feel myself circling around a bit, looking forward to setting more "fun" goals for the coming year. Here are some of the goals I'm setting out for myself:

1. Read and thoroughly enjoy more books than last year, at least 20, including:
  - ~~Murakami, Kafka on the Shore~~  
  - Wright, Native Son  
  - ~~Morrison, Beloved~~  
  - Céline, Journey to the End of the Night  
  - ~~Camus, The Stranger~~  
  - Rulfo, Pedro Páramo  
  - Proust, Swann's Way  
  - ~~Kingsolver, The Bean Trees~~  
  - ~~Achebe, Things Fall Apart~~  
  - Knausgaard, My Struggle  
2. Run a sub-3 hour marathon
3. Run in a 100-mile race, *and* finish within 24 hours
4. Submit 4 substantive pieces of scholarly writing
5. Record listening to at least 12,000 tracks, my third-highest year
6. Visit a new national park 
7. Don't work evenings or weekends
