- Wrote a chapter of my dissertation.

- Decided I wouldn't apply for jobs this year.

- Was interviewed formally twice and informally twice (4 times total) about my research.

- Gluten-free.


Resolutions for 2014

- Finish my dissertation.

- Get a job.

- Finish reading *The Wind-up Bird Chronicles*, *Thus Spoke Zarathustra*, *Ulysses* (this is the third year this was on my list of resolutions), *The Hunchback of Notre Dame*. 

- At least once a month - more if possible - write a blog post here and an album review for *The Sights and Sounds*.

- Facebook sucks. Don't get on more than once a day.

- Don't take on more work. Just finish things.
