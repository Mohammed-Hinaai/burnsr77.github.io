Tomorrow my colleague [Joe Eckert](http://students.washington.edu/jeckert1/) and I will chair [the panel session we organized](http://meridian.aag.org/callforpapers/program/SessionDetail.cfm?SessionID=12128). Entitled "Critical Perspectives on Software and Space", the session aims to bridge any remaining gap between critical geographic theory and the burgeoning field of software studies. On board we have [Sarah Elwood](http://faculty.washington.edu/selwood/) introducing the session, [Mark Graham](http://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/people/?id=165), [Wendy Chun](http://www.brown.edu/Departments/MCM/people/facultypage.php?id=10109), [Rob Kitchin](http://geography.nuim.ie/staff/kitchinrob), [Matthew Zook](http://www.zook.info/), and [Matt Wilson](http://mwwilson.iweb.bsu.edu/) acting as discussant. The session is at 2:40 in room 603 (Level 6 of the convention center). Should be a great panel, and I'm looking forward to some very engaging conversation. Stop by and say hi!

On Wednesday morning at 8:00 I'm giving [my personal presentation](http://meridian.aag.org/callforpapers/program/AbstractDetail.cfm?AbstractID=35841), which I have called "Software-sorted geographies of the urban global South". In this presentation I'm trying to do two things: bring an attention to software within conversations of the urban global South, and to take software & space literatures beyond their overwhelming focus on the global North. This presentation will be in the Sheraton Hotel, Union Tower, 4th floor, Boren Room (whew, that's a mouthful!). I'd also love to see you there! :\) 

Cheers, and have a great week at the AAG!
