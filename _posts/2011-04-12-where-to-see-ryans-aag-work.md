Tomorrow my colleague [Joe Eckert][1] and I will chair [the panel session we organized][2]. Entitled “Critical Perspectives on Software and Space”, the session aims to bridge any remaining gap between critical geographic theory and the burgeoning field of software studies. On board we have [Sarah Elwood][3] introducing the session, [Mark Graham][4], [Wendy Chun][5], [Rob Kitchin][6], [Matthew Zook][7], and [Matt Wilson][8] acting as discussant. The session is at 2:40 in room 603 (Level 6 of the convention center). Should be a great panel, and I’m looking forward to some very engaging conversation. Stop by and say hi!

On Wednesday morning at 8:00 I’m giving [my personal presentation][9], which I have called “Software-sorted geographies of the urban global South”. In this presentation I’m trying to do two things: bring an attention to software within conversations of the urban global South, and to take software & space literatures beyond their overwhelming focus on the global North. This presentation will be in the Sheraton Hotel, Union Tower, 4th floor, Boren Room (whew, that’s a mouthful!). I’d also love to see you there! ![:)][10]
