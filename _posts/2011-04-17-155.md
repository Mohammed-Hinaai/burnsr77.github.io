Verso Books has translated [Losurdo's *Liberalism: A Counter-History*](http://www.versobooks.com/books/960-liberalism). I've obviously never read it, but the description makes it sound essential. Looks very, very good! Thanks to [Progressive Geographies](http://progressivegeographies.com/2011/04/14/a-counter-history-of-liberalism/) for the link!
