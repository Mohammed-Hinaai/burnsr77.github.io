This spring quarter (March 26-June 8) will be a big one if I sit back and cruise, but I want it to be even bigger. I managed to have an outstandingly productive winter quarter, and I want to continue that productivity. Here are my concrete goals that I want to reach before June:

1.  Take my general exams 3rd weekend of this quarter
2.  I hope to hear back from the NSF and the Fritz-Boeing (internal UW fellowship) on whether my research will be funded
3.  Finish, at long last, my thesis write-up and submit it to [Cartographica][1]
4.  Draft a paper on the interface development for the [Mapping Youth Journeys][2] project
5.  Draft a paper on poverty, inequality, and the geoweb for a special issue of [GeoJournal][3]
6.  Develop course material for the Urban GIS class I will teach this summer
7.  Begin thinking about potential sessions to organize for the [2013 AAG][4] in Los Angeles

I think these are all do-able if I focus my energy and work efficiently (which was one of my [New Year's resolutions][5]!). Productivity/efficiency tips are welcome!
