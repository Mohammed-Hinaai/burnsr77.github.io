I don't typically post my talks to my website, but I quite liked how this one turned out. I'm providing the slides here, and find the text of the talk in the notes section. I welcome feedback, particularly as it relates to smart cities research I may have missed. In the session I learned of great overlaps with [Simon Joss's /(U of Westminster/)](https://www.westminster.ac.uk/about-us/our-people/directory/joss-simon) ongoing research with [Matthew Cook /(Open U/)](http://www.open.ac.uk/people/mc22226), PhD candidate [Joe Blakey's /(U of Manchester/)](http://joeblakey.com/) research on open data, and (Gynna Millan's /(Queen Mary U of London/)](http://www.busman.qmul.ac.uk/staff/phd/profiles/gynna-farith-millan-franco.html) connection of smart cities with civic participation. Lots of overlap with others, too, and I was excited to see potential avenues for future collaboration.
