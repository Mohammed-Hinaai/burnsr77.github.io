<strike>something by HP Lovecraft</strike>

i'm a little embarrassed to admit i've never read these. this will be the year.  

12/22/12 UPDATE: I decided on One Hundred Years of Solitude indtead of Love in the Time of Cholera.  

11/30/12 UPDATE: I'm feeling somewhat disappointed in myself for not getting to more of these this year. I need to make a list of all I've read this year to make up for my lack of progress!  

7/26/12 UPDATE: I'm striking these off as i go along. For HP Lovecraft I read a couple of his short stories, including "The Thing on the Doorstep", "The White Ship", "The Temple", and "The Quest of Iranon". Eventually I'd like to get around to *Necronomicon*.  

2/18/12 UPDATE: I've decided on "Turn of the Screw" instead of "Wings of the Dove" by Henry James.
