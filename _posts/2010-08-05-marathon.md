Last Sunday (8/1) I began training for the upcoming Seattle Marathon (11/28). Every other day I run for a period of time, and that time is increasing steadily week-by-week. For my own progress monitoring I am recording my paths, but I am making this publicly available in case others are interested (snicker). Enjoy (snicker again)!

8/17 update: i'm now running 10 miles in 1.5 hours. and icing down my ankles when i finish (lol).
