Below is my Google Calendar for the week of the AAG (April 11-16) here in Seattle. Of particular interest here is the “Critical Perspectives on Software & Space”, slated for Tuesday 2:40-4:20. My colleague [Joe Eckert][1] and I organized this and have quite the all-star lineup. I’ll post something else about this a little later.

Also, my personal presentation is Wednesday 8:00 in the “Urban Spaces of the Global South” session organized by [Leslie McLees][2] from University of Oregon. My talk is titled [“Software-sorted Geographies of the Urban Global South”][3] and relates to the production of global South urban spaces through software.
