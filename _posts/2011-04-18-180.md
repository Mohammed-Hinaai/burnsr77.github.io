Today again I am hardly myself.  
It happens over and over.  
It is heaven-sent.

It flows through me  
like the blue wave.  
Green leaves - you may believe this or not -  
have once or twice  
emerged from the tips of my fingers

somewhere  
deep in the woods,  
in the reckless seizure of spring.

Though, of course, I also know that other song,  
the sweet passion of one-ness.

Just yesterday I watched an ant crossing a path, through the  
tumbled pine needles she toiled.  
And I thought: she will never live another life but this one.  
And I thought: if she lives her life with all her strength  
is she not wonderful and wise?  
And I continued this up the miraculous pyramid of everything  
until I came to myself.

And still, even in these northern woods, on these hills of sand,  
I have flown from the other window of myself  
to become white heron, blue whale,  
red fox, hedgehog.  
Oh, sometimes already my body has felt like the body of a flower!  
Sometimes already my heart is a red parrot, perched  
among strange, dark trees, flapping and screaming.
