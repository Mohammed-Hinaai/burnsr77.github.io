Had a couple deadlines this week. The biggest deadline was a huge grant application due today, but Sarah Elwood, Katharyne Mitchell and I also launched another iteration of our “Mapping Youth Journeys” project this morning. Needless to say, I’m just now coming up for air. I’m several emails behind, too, so apologies if you’ve been waiting for a response from me.

These deadlines have also slowed down my writing on inequality, poverty, and the geoweb. The next piece is just about finished and will be published within a few days. 

Thanks for checking in!
