in true ryan burns style, i’ve come up with a few new year’s resolutions - almost 2 weeks into the new year.

Ordered by importance:  
1.  pass generals, get funding  
2.  work more efficiently - not *more* or *harder*, but more efficiently  
3.  become more familiar with the contemporary art scene  
4.  average out listening to 4-5 cds per day. don’t know how i can reasonably keep track of that, but we’ll see...  
5.  write more

<ul><li>finish thesis write-up and submit</li>
<li>write a paper for MYJ</li>
<li>write public scholarship paper</li>
<li>write crisis mapping paper</li></ul>

6.  watch all those movies i’ve been wanting to watch - with the time i now have to spare from working more efficiently  
7.  finish that reading list i made [a while back](http://burnsr77.github.io/2011/11/reading-list/)
