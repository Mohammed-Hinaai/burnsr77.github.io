The new school year is taking off for me next week, and that means I will begin blogging again. During the summer I have fewer things to say, apparently, since I'm not bombarded with new ideas every day.

My goal for this year is to post a new entry at least once a week. I hope to use this space as a sort of "think piece" to remind myself what I learned/accomplished during the week and to sort out some of my thoughts. Thus the weekly posting will discuss the readings I did, struggle with some of the concepts and theories I encountered, and explore thoughts as they relate to my dissertation. Hopefully it will also help me practice writing.
