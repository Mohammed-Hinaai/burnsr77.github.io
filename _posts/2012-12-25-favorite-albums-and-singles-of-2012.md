I wasn’t going to post a list this year because I didn’t put too much effort into staying up-to-date with the scene. This is despite falling in love with nearly everything I heard from 2012. In fact, there were very few albums I heard that I didn’t like. Perhaps that’s why I somewhat stalled out around September. Anyway, enough babble, here’s my top 30 albums. After the first 10 or so the order becomes somewhat ambiguous in my mind.

1. Purity Ring – Shrines  
2. Orcas – Orcas  
3. Grimes – Visions  
4. Kyle Bobby Dunn – Bring Me The Head of Kyle Bobby Dunn  
5. Tiny Leaves – What We Dream Of…  
6. Alt-J – An Awesome Wave  
7. Earth – Angels of Darkness, Demons of Light II  
8. Tame Impala – Lonerism  
9. Laurel Halo – Quarantine  
10. Pelt – Effigy  
11. Twin Shadow – Confess  
12. Cloud Nothings – Attack on Memory  
13. Biosphere – L’Incoronazione Di Poppea  
14. Swans – The Seer  
15. Chromatics – Kill for Love  
16. Ceremony – Zoo  
17. Crystal Castles – iii  
18. Grizzly Bear – Shields  
19. Helios – Moiety  
20. Mirroring – Foreign Body  
21. Japandroids – Celebration Rock  
22. Sigur Rós – Valtari  
23. Sun Kil Moon – Among The Leaves  
24. Ariel Pink’s Haunted Graffiti – Mature Themes  
25. Actress – RIP  
26. Sharon van Etten – Tramp  
27. Godspeed You! Black Emperor – ‘Allelujah! Don’t Bend! Ascend!  
28. Laura Gibson – La Grande  
29. Gaza – No Absolutes in Human Suffering  
30. First Aid Kit – Lion’s Roar

And there were several singles I loved:  
(Probably most-listened-to track of the year) Summer Camp – Losing My Mind (St. Etienne remix)  
St. Lucia – Before the Dive  
Father John Misty – Hollywood Forever Cemetery Sings  
Caves – Eleven Twenty  
Santigold – Disparate Youth  
Taken by Trees – Dreams  
Dum Dum Girls – I’ve Got Nothing  
Electric Youth – The Best Thing  
Deadmau5 – The Veldt

And a few honorable mention albums:  
Porcelain Raft – Strange Weekend  
Jason Lescalleet – Songs about Nothing  
The xx – Coexist  
Frank Orange – Channel Orange  
Belleruche – Rollerchain  
TV Girl – The Wild, the Innocent, the TV Shuffle  
Fushitsusha – Mabushii Itazura Na Inori

A few albums I haven’t listened to enough to put on this list, but that I liked on my first few listens:
