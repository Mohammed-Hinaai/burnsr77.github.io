Came across this poem on the [Rec.Food.Drink.Tea Google group][1]  
Lu Tong's Seven Bowls of Tea
-Lu Tong (Tang. 790~835)

 [1]: http://groups.google.com/group/rec.food.drink.tea/topics

The first bowl moistens my lips and throat; 
The second bowl breaks my loneliness;
The third bowl searches my barren entrails but to find
Therein some five thousand scrolls;
The fourth bowl raises a slight perspiration
And all life's inequities pass out through my pores;
The fifth bowl purifies my flesh and bones;
The sixth bowl calls me to the immortals.
The seventh bowl could not be drunk,
only the breath of the cool wind raises in my sleeves.  
Where is Penglai Island, Yuchuanzi wishes to ride on this sweet breeze and go back. 
(Steven R. Jones 2008)
