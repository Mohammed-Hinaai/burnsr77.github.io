Here’s the living document (read: not even close to finalized!) of where you can find me at the AAG next week. Out of these I organized the panels “[Critical Interventions into Gender & the Geoweb][1]” and “[Whither Small Data?][2]“. I’ll be the discussant on the former, and the chair on the latter. I’ll also be serving as discussant for the session “Crowdsourcing Crisis” on Friday. There will likely be some edits, additions, and subtractions, but I’ll try to update accordingly! If you happen to run into me, say hi! ![:)][3]
