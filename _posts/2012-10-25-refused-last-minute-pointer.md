heard this song for the first time in a long time, and thought it apropos the election season. but it seems to me to be a song not about voting in the literal sense, but about how one’s daily interjections into everyday politics matter as a form of political self-expression. in other words, one votes in your everyday language, actions, advocacy, and silence.

  
Is there a single thing  
That’d make you comprehend  
As long as we shut up  
We still sanction them?

My silence will convict me (x3)

As the parade continues  
On every bloodstained flag  
We sum up statistics  
Still buried in the sand

My silence will convict me (x3)

With our silence  
We vote for  
Continuation

With our silence  
We vote for  
Continuation
