In making this list I realized that 2010 was a great year for music. Several follow-up CDs either met or exceeded expectations, many bands settled well into new sounds, and other awesome new bands arose. Below is a list of some of the new releases I heard this year. Unfortunately I couldn't list more due to time constraints, but these were the most prominent releases of the year for me. 

Top 20 Favorites
1. Deerhunter - Halcyon Digest
2. Tame Impala - Innerspeaker  
3. Arcade Fire - The Suburbs  
4. Yellow Swans - Going Places  
5. Beach House - Teen Dream  
6. Fursaxa - Mycorrhizae Realm  
7. Laura Veirs - July Flame  
8. Joanna Newsom - Have One on Me  
9. Caribou - Swim  
10. Eluvium - Similies  
11. LCD Soundsystem - This Is Happening

Runners-up
1. The Black Keys - Brothers (way talented and catchy, but not quite my style)  
2. The North Sea - Bloodlines (growing on me)  
3. Delta Spirit - History from Below (great CD, but for some reason quickly fell out of my playlist)  
4. Sufjan Stevens - Age of Adz (maybe it was bad timing for me, but I never really got into it, sadly...)  
5. The Books - The Way Out (just discovered this today and loved it, but not enough times to put in top 20)  
6. The Roots - How I Got Over (only had a chance to hear it once and it was great, but couldn't put it in top 20)  
7. The Magnetic Fields - Realism (good, not great)
