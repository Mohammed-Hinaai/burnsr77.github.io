And... more from the good news department: the special issue I helped co-organize with [Jim Thatcher](https://twitter.com/alogicalfallacy?lang=en) and [Craig Dalton](http://www.hofstra.edu/faculty/fac_profiles.cfm?id=5468&t=/Academics/Colleges/HCLAS/GEOG/) is now [live at Professional Geographer](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00330124.2017.1325749)! The issue features pieces written by Jim, [David O'Sullivan](http://geography.berkeley.edu/people/regular-faculty/david-osullivan/), and [Luke Bergmann](https://faculty.washington.edu/lrb9/) on one paper; Craig Dalton on another; [Beyhan Farhadi](http://geography.utoronto.ca/profiles/beyhan-farhadi/); Jamison Miller and [Jen Jack Gieseking](http://jgieseking.org/). For the record, our author list on the Introduction is *alphabetical*, as I think both Jim and Craig put more into the organizing than I did. 

If you've read this far, you may also be interested to know that I'm hosting the Intro [here](/assets/uploads/burns_dalton_thatcher_critical_data.pdf). Enjoy!
