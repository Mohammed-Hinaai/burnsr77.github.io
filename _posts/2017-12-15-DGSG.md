You may have arrived here because you followed the link on the Digital Geographies Specialty Group's (DGSG) ballot (just curious - how *did* you arrive here? Leave a comment below!). I'm running for one of two boardmember positions, and I thought I'd give you a few reasons you might want to vote for me, and briefly give you a sense of my vision for the group. Before doing that, though, let me be honest with you: I *love* and greatly respect the work of the other two candidates, each of whom have laid the essential groundwork for my own explorations. I'm going to be thrilled no matter the outcome of the election!

Let me introduce myself. In a sentence, my research contributes to debates about the social, institutional, and spatial implications of new technologies. In the past I've looked at digital humanitarianism: the use of social media, digital labor, crowdsourcing, and other sensors to produce knowledge about crises. I'm now mostly focusing on smart cities, and their open data platform strategies. For both of these I focus on the inequalities, variegations, and modalities of these socio-technical phenomenon. What forms of knowledge production do they enable, frame, and disallow? What epistemologies do they promote? Who gets left out, and in whose interest? For more info on my research interests, see [my research page](/research).

Despite my junior status, I'm no newcomer to the AAG leadership: if elected, the boardmember role would be my fourth position in the AAG's specialty groups. I was the webmaster (formally: "chairperson for the communications collective") for the Socialist & Critical Geography Specialty Group for a good 4 years. I really only gave up that position, which I loved, to become the student representative for the GISS specialty group. From that elected role I was elected to become the secretary/treasurer in the same SG - all combined, it was a total of six years, 2008-2014. It might behoove such a new specialty group as DGSG to elect someone with this amount of very recent "institutional memory", so to speak, and that's one way I stand out from the other two candidates.

If I may say so myself (and it does feel weird to do so!), I think I'm on a pretty good track for advancing the field of digital geographies. With current chair [Jim Thatcher](https://twitter.com/alogicalfallacy?lang=en) I've organized special issues on [big/small data](https://link.springer.com/journal/10708/80/4/page/1) in (GeoJournal) and [critical data studies](http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rtpg20/70/1?nav=tocList) (Professional Geographer; h/t co-organizer [Craig Dalton](https://www.hofstra.edu/faculty/fac_profiles.cfm?id=5468&t=/Academics/Colleges/HCLAS/GEOG)!), and with current student rep [Nick Lally](http://www.nicklally.com) a [special section and substantive introduction](http://computationalculture.net) on geographical software studies in Computational Culture. I have an article forthcoming in the 2018 social justice special issue of the Annals of the AAG, and a chapter in Mark Graham's MIT Press book he's entitled "Digital Economies at the Global Margins". They're both about digital humanitarianism - the former about institutional framings of data production, and the latter about how DH facilitates a new form of philanthro-capitalism.

For some in my potential audience it may also be worth mentioning that I have the applied tech skills as well. As part of a 4-year Spencer Foundation project on youth mapping with [Sarah Elwood](https://geography.washington.edu/people/sarah-elwood) and [Katharyne Mitchell](https://socialsciences.ucsc.edu/about/contact/index.php?uid=kmitch), I built an interactive web mapping interface using free and open-source tools and a range of Python and Javascript libraries. This project involved using my mapping platform at Seattle after-school programs, where youth mapped their everyday geographies and the spatial histories of racial and ethnic minorities in Seattle. In [research conducted 2008-2009](http://www.utpjournals.press/doi/abs/10.3138/carto.48.3.1691), I used the high-dimensional visualization technique the Self-organizing Map (SOM) to explore people’s (digitally) written descriptions of San Diego neighborhoods. The SOM is a quantitative technique useful for teasing out themes and structures from large volumes of unstructured semantic data. I used this technique to arrange neighborhoods on a map based on similarities in people’s descriptions of them, allowing me to identify similarities between neighborhoods’ attributes, as condensed from a very large dataset. Scripting is never the sole learning objective of my courses, but I do teach advanced GIS and web mapping largely with Python and JavaScript, respectively.

I anticipate a unique and exciting challenge facing the DGSG: how can we develop a distinct identity from the AAG's cognate SGs, while still strengthening our connections with them? There are already at least two SGs with some sort of explicitly digital focus - GISS and Cybergeography - and many others are quite conducive to digital inquiry, like Cartography, Urban Geography, Communications Geography, and Cultural Geography. I maintain that we're holding a distinct conversation from them but we're still contributing to the broadest understanding of those fields. As boardmember, I will work to differentiate ourselves from other related specialty groups by facilitating and promoting work that explores how social, political, economic, cultural, and institutional forces and relations operate through digital objects and practices. This means, as well, interrogating how knowledge production takes place in and through digital technologies. At the same time, we can learn a lot about what works and what doesn't by having open conversations with other groups, and this is where my work with some of them will come in handy. I envision mobilizing the connections I've made in other groups to get the DGSG off on the right foot.

On a more practical note, I'd like to help the DGSG set up some mechanisms for funding junior scholars and people of color - scholarships, awards, and so on. I can also foresee many outcomes from our SG's collaborative possibilities: a symposium, a multi-authored position piece setting a digital geographies research agenda, and liaison roles for stakeholders such as communities, activists, policymakers, and businesses. 

In the end, it's really an amazing set of candidates, right? The DGSG is off to a promising start, and I look forward to being part of that future.
