**research interests**
I am interested in mentoring graduate students who are equally enthralled by critical social theory and new technologies. If you spend mornings reading David Harvey and by evenings switch to Mike Goodchild, get in touch. If you get the sense that there's probably more to technology, data, and software than just 0s and 1s, and that they are instead part of what constitutes the social, send me an email. If, instead, you agree with 1995-era Eric Sheppard that the 0s and 1s are fundamental to framing computational thinking, and the word "epistemology" comes up in your defense, please reach out!

As much as I enjoy teaching scripting, models, database design, and spatial analysis, they are not central to my research and thus I would likely not make a good PhD adviser for these sorts of research interests (but at the master's level we could probably work something out). 

More broadly, in your search for a graduate-level adviser, you should find someone who *already* does the work that you want to do. The more precisely these align, the better. The reason is that your graduate adviser should know the ins and outs of your field well enough to provide advice, feedback, and pointers. For example, if you ask me about spatial optimization models for detecting post-disaster economic impacts, I simply won't know what to tell you; if, however, you ask about the political imperatives that uneven disaster impacts serve, and the ways geoweb technologies produce new inequalities, I can advise you on that all day. Before emailing potential advisers, read their faculty profiles. Look at their institutional background. Read a few of their publications. As yourself if you can see yourself writing these in a few years' time. Ask yourself if there's something about their geographic location (Calgary, for me) that makes their department particularly appealing. Check with the prospective advisers' existing and past graduate students to see what kind of a mentor they are (e.g., are they physically present in the department? are they responsive and timely? are they empathetic? politically efficacious in the department, university, and field?). Are they a bigshot in the field, and if so, will it bother you if they're all the time jetting around the world to give talks? All of these considerations should take place before you contact them. 

**mentoring philosophy**
The desire to meet individuals *where they are* drives my overarching approach toward advising. This comes largely from personal experience: I've undergone quite dramatic intellectual change in my adult life, and while tackling these challenges were greatly rewarding in exposing me to new ideas, it may have appeared as "lagging" in those new areas. Coming from a GIScience background and beginning at an undergraduate-only institution, the transition into graduate school was itself a shock, and it was even more a shock moving into the areas of humanitarianism, critical social theory, and politically-engaged research. I only managed to progress in my own unique intelletual development in ways that were productive, facilitating, and mentally safe, because people around me understood that I would not *start* where they already were, and it would take some time to grow there.

I take the same approach in my mentoring. My goal is to help you find your own intellectual path, and encourage and push you along the way. Hands-off/hands-on, nudging/retreating; whatever your needs are, my goal is to meet you where you are.

**FAQs**

*Would you be a good adviser for me?*
If you want to do research that falls easily among multiple subdisciplines of geography, but broadly within social and political implications of GIScience, probably yes! Even better if you are interested in qualitative methodologies -- but this is not a necessity. Within these areas, I myself love work that borrows from critical social theory, economic geography, cultural geography, political geography, Big Data, geoweb, etc., etc. I welcome broad thought.

If your interests extend *only* to technical work: if you are interested only in developing new models, using cellular automata, producing a new remote sensing classification, or finding new Big Data analytical methods, without taking a step back into the social/political realm, I would probably not be a good mentor for this work. If there's a strong social or political bent to your work with the above listed items, that's great - reach out!
