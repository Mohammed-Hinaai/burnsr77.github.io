**Technology & Society**

I am most interested in the social and political implications of new technologies. My current research is looking at the paradigmatic shift toward new modes of mapping, spatial data production, and collaborative data processing. Specifically, it investigates whether, and how, the ‘geoweb’ may be shifting organizations’ emergency management and humanitarian strategies. The geoweb, an emerging set of geographic web-based practices, artifacts, and software/hardware configurations, is exemplified in mapping websites like Ushahidi and OpenStreetMap, sites that open spatial data production and processing to large numbers of people who may not be located in crisis areas. This process, called ‘crisis mapping’, has received wide public and academic interest, although it is unclear theimpact these technologies are having on strategies and decision-making processes.

For my master’s thesis, I tried to take a critical look at geovisualization by interjecting the very personal aspects of place experience into a Self-Organizing Map (SOM). Research participants first gave me some of their background information such as their age, year in school, socioeconomic status, and religion. They were then presented 10 videos of San Diego and were asked to record their impressions of those neighborhoods. I then had a robust dataset through which I could explore the interactions between their personal attributes, their utterances about the places, and the neighborhoods themselves.

Technologically, I have learned several programming languages, statistical software programs, GIS programs (obviously I’m most well-versed in ArcMap), and HTML editors. For more on my technological experience, see \[my CV page\]\[5\].

My long-term goals are to expand our understanding of how technologies embody and in turn influence social and political relations.

**Music**

Check out what I’m listening to here: \[Last.fm\]\[7\]  
I like everything from indie to electronica, from ambient/drone to metal, from modern-classical to psychedelic free folk, from 60s avant-garde jazz to Azeri, from field recordings to sludge metal.

**Tea**

i love tea... what more do you want? Favorite: Silver Needle. An Ji Bai Cha. Cold Summit Tung Ting. Tie Guan Yin. Bi Luo Chun. Yunnan Gold.

White tea in general is probably my favorite tea to drink, but usually only the non-flavored types. White peony is a good example of a well-rounded white tea that has delicate, subtle floral flavors.
