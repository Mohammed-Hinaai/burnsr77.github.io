## Music reviewer

For about a year now [I've been writing reviews](http://thesightsandsounds.com/author/burnsr77/) of experimental, minimalist, ambient, and generally "weird" electronic tunes over at [The Sights and Sounds](http://thesightsandsounds.com/). Proud to say that it's a genuinely incredible cadre of writers, and we've been rated at #39 most important music blog by [The Style of Sound](http://styleofsound.com/top-100-influential-music-blogs/) \(of course it's behind a paywall\). I enjoy writing there for a number of reasons, including the fact that it forces me to stay current on the scene, and it's a productive non-academic outlet of creative expression.

I don't only listen to that genre, though. Check out what I'm listening to here: [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/east_west)

## Ultra-marathon runner

I'm an ultra-marathon runner. Well, that may be a bit of a stretch, since to date I've only run a single 50km race. But I'm registered for a 100-mile race in March and may run a few others in the meantime. I'm including it here, though, because running long distances forms a large part of my identity at the moment. I volunteer regularly at races, often run further than 20 miles in a workout, and am even a regular reader of UltraRunning Magazine! I am usually confronted with blank stares when I confess to people that I really enjoy watching ultra videos on YouTube!    

If I may brag for a moment... I also think I'm quite "good" at running: I won 3rd place in my first marathon in February 2014, and 6th in my 50k. That marathon had 1600 feet of elevation gain, and the ultra 4200 feet over 31 miles. The sense of community among ultrarunners is stronger than 23-year-old Arnold, and it's ridiculously easy to meet people through this sport.

## Photography

In 2014 I discovered photography.

## Tea

Favorites: Silver Needle, An Ji Bai Cha, Cold Summit Tung Ting, Tie Guan Yin, Bi Luo Chun, Yunnan Gold.

White tea in general is probably my favorite tea to drink, but usually only the non-flavored types. White peony is a good example of a well-rounded white tea that has delicate, subtle floral flavors.
