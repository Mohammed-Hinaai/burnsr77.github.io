Here I’ve thrown a couple things together which I think illustrate my academic and personal interests. Needless to say, my more reticent side makes note that most of these are **far** from perfect; I’ll post more and better examples as they come along. Just, ah, mind the copyrights I have on these, please? Thanks!

These are just a couple of my unpublished writing samples. Note that publications are linked in my [CV][4].

**Technology & Geography: Rethinking the Classroom**[ [pdf]][5]

 [5]: ../ptflio/burns - technology and geography.pdf

The adoption of technology in the classroom is gaining momentum and changing predominant instructional and learning methods. However, this adoption raises several questions, two of which are explored in this paper. Using the example of a GIS class, this paper asks how technologies can be used to effectively teach geography, and conversely, how geographic concepts are adapted for a technological context. I argue, through evidence gathered from participant observation, individual interviews, and a focus group interview, that pedagogical environments should be reconceptualized as complex multidirectional conversations that work to build meanings for students and instructors. This conceptualization seeks to reverse the idea of the classroom as a space for the transferral of static meanings from instructor to student, instead asserting that meanings are constructed in the process of conversation.

**“Main Street is a Prostitution Strip”: Mappings, Representations, and Discourse** [ [pdf]][6]

 [6]: ../ptflio/Burns - main street is a prostitution strip _ mappings, representations, and discourse.pdf

In this paper my goal is to argue that mappings, as representations, should be conceptualized as discourses. I use the empirical example of “Mapping Main Street” to illustrate how these concepts play out in a real sense in our day-to-day lives. The main criticism I have received (so far) of this paper is that I conflate the theoretical “hegemony” with the theoretical “discourse”. However, it should be clear that I was using hegemony casually, to invoke the idea of a dominant way of thinking that is the result of political and social discourse.

**Statement of interest and intent for UW’s Simpson Center Certificate in Public Scholarship Program** [[pdf]][7]

 [7]: ../ptflio/Burns_CiPS_letter.pdf

This is the statement of interest I submitted for the Certificate in Public Scholarship program, hosted through the Simpson Center. I owe a huge debt of gratitude to Sarah Elwood for awesome feedback and for writing the letter of reference (and for all her support!), and to Katharyne Mitchell likewise for great feedback and for advice/support.

**Personal statement for admission to the University of Washington** [[pdf]][8]

 [8]: ../ptflio/UW_StatementOfPurpose.pdf

This is the statement of purpose that I sent to the Geography Department at University of Washington. Although I was far from satisfied with it upon submission, it helped earn me unanimous support by the admissions committee (I am also indebted to those profs who wrote my letters of reference!)

**Statement of Purpose for the 2009 CaGIS Master’s Scholarship ($500)** [[pdf]][9]

 [9]: ../ptflio/Burns - 2009_CaGIS_SOP.pdf

This 1-page statement helped me get this scholarship. I also owe a huge “thank you” to Dr. André Skupin for the letter of reference.

## Maps

**San Diego Trolley Map**  
[![trolley_web][11]][11]  
This map helped me win the 2007 SDSU Map Design Competition. It’s an imaginary map of what the San Diego trolley system *should* look like in my mind. It’s based roughly off the official trolley map with elements borrowed from the London Tube map.
